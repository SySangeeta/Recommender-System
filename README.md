**1. Introduction**

The Recommendation System is a Python-based framework designed to provide personalized product recommendations. It leverages user interaction data, product information, and hybrid recommendation models (collaborative, content-based, and popularity-based methods) to enhance user experience and maximize engagement.

**2. Features**
1)	Data Preparation: Preprocessing datasets, generating implicit ratings, and feature engineering.
2)	EDA: Exploratory data analysis with insightful visualizations.
3)	Collaborative Filtering: User-item interactions for tailored recommendations.
4)	Content-Based Recommendations: Using item features and TF-IDF vectorization for suggestions.
5)	Hybrid Approaches: Combining multiple techniques for improved accuracy.
6)	Cold Start: Recommendations for new users using demographic or global popularity.
7)	Evaluation Metrics: Assessing models with metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG, and F1@K.

**3. Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
1)	Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
2)	Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
3)	Machine Learning: scikit-learn
4)	Natural Language Processing: TfidfVectorizer
5)	Dimensionality Reduction: TruncatedSVD
6)	Recommendation Models: NearestNeighbors, SVR


**4. Data Requirements**

This system requires the following datasets:
1. Customer Data: Contains user information (e.g., ID, age, gender, date of birth).
2. Product Data: Includes product categories and subcategories.
3. Transaction Data: Logs of customer transactions, including date, total amount, and product IDs.

Example Schema
Customer File: cust_id, DOB, Gender, etc.
Product File: prod_cat_code, prod_subcat_code, etc.
Transaction File: tran_date, cust_id, prod_cat_code, total_amt, etc.

**5. Usage**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place datasets (customer.csv, product.csv, transactions.csv) in the project directory.
4. Initialize and run the system:
    from recommendation_system import RecommendationSystem

# Initialize the system
  rs = RecommendationSystem('customer.csv', 'product.csv', 'transactions.csv')
# Prepare data
  rs.prepare_data()
# Perform EDA
  rs.perform_eda()
# Build user-item matrix and models
   rs.create_user_item_matrix()
   rs.apply_svd()
   rs.compute_tfidf_similarity()

# Generate recommendations
  recommendations = rs.recommend_svd(user_id=275262, top_n=10)
  print("Recommendations:", recommendations)


**6. Methods and Models**

1. Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Factorization: SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to reduce dimensions.
KNN-Based Filtering: Identifies similar users/items for recommendations.

2. Content-Based Filtering
TF-IDF vectorization of item features.

3. Hybrid Models
Weighted combinations of collaborative, content-based, and demographic/popularity scores.

4. Cold Start Recommendations
For new users: Based on demographic or globally popular items.


**7. Evaluation Metrics**

The system uses advanced metrics to evaluate recommendation performance:
Precision@K: Proportion of relevant items in the top K recommendations.
Recall@K: Proportion of relevant items retrieved out of all relevant items.
NDCG@K: Evaluates the ranking quality of recommendations.
F1@K: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
MRR: Mean Reciprocal Rank for ranking relevance.

**8. Future Enhancements**

Integration with Deep Learning: Incorporate neural networks like Autoencoders.
Real-Time Recommendations: Streamlined for live interactions.
Personalization Enhancements: Use advanced demographic features.
Dynamic Item Features: Handle evolving product attributes over time.
